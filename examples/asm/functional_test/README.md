This is a test suite for 6502/65C02/65C816 processors. It contains a plethora of
tests, which covers all documented opcodes.

Note that the binary was not built from the source code in the repository, but
pre-built binaries were used instead. That is because the source code is not
compatible with the assembler used by the [cc65](https://cc65.github.io/cc65/)
toolchain.
